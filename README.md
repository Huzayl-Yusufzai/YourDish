## Inspiration

I always felt like we as a society have started moving to the path of primarily fast food and processed meals. They are quick and easy, and you don't have to waste time finding the meal you want. We all know that it's unhealthy, so I wanted to make cooking as quick and easy as I could behind a screen. That's how I came up with YourDish!

## What it does

YourDish first presents you with a screen that displays different regions from across the world. Once you select one, it brings you to a page filled with different foods! Hover over them, and you'll see the name of the dish and where it came from. If you click on one of them, it will bring you to a page complete with an overview, step by step process of its creation, ingredient list (With checkboxes to keep track of the ingredients you have), and a video detailing the process visually with the same ingredients.  

## How we built it

The frame and structure of the website was all done in HTML and the styling was completed using CSS. Things like buttons, text and videos were all planned out using HTML, and the banners, colours, and some positioning was sorted out using CSS.

## Challenges we ran into

The alignment of certain elements was a bit tricky to figure out since before this I didn't really understand out to effectively do it. This lead to a lot of trail and error with my CSS and HTML so that I could put everything I wanted in the place they were supposed to be. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

I was very happy that I was able to put everything I had come up with in my head into the website. I was invitationally worried that it was going to take longer than expect to implement everything and that I was going to have to cut it short, but that wasn't the case at all. I was able to finish in time as I wanted.

## What we learned

The main thing I learned was positioning different elements to my liking. I had a lot more success this time around than I previously have had, which I credit to taking the time to learn about display, float, and position. Proper understanding of these functions really streamline the process of web development for me. 

## What's next for YOURDISH

I would like to add more foods to each of the regions and add something like an organizing system which would categorize each food in the region (i.e. pasta, soup, pastry etc.) I would also love to add a feature which details the nutritional value of the foods presented so users cam better understand what they are eating and be more healthy.
